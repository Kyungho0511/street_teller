# Street Teller - site selection web tool

The Street Teller is a web application integrated with a large language model (LLM) that provides a data-driven methodology for site down-selection. Users can sort urban data based on their preferences, and the application identifies target clusters that align with those interests. After users select the clusters they wish to target, the application recursively recommends more granular clusters within the initial selections. This iterative process allows for progressively refined site down-selection.

## Decision Making Process in down-selecting clusters

The application utilizes the OpenAI API to assign meaningful labels and interpretations to each cluster generated by the machine learning (ML) clustering algorithm. The LLM translates the numeric results of the clustering analysis into human-readable language. Human decision-makers are then expected to review and select the clusters identified by the LLM. This iterative exchange between the user and the LLM enables precise targeting.
